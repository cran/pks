\title{Responses and Knowledge Structures from Taagepera et al. (1997)}
\description{
  Taagepera et al. (1997) applied knowledge space theory to specific science
  problems.  The density test was administered to 2060 students, the
  conservation of matter test to 1620 students.  A subtest of five items each
  is included here.  The response frequencies were reconstructed from
  histograms in the paper.
}
\usage{data(Taagepera)}
\format{
  Two lists, each consisting of two components:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{density97}}{a list with components \code{K} and \code{N.R} for
      the density test.}
    \item{\code{matter97}}{a list with components \code{K} and \code{N.R} for
      the conservation of matter test.}
    \item{\code{K}}{a state-by-problem indicator matrix representing the
      hypothetical knowledge structure.  An element is one if the problem
      is contained in the state, and else zero.}
    \item{\code{N.R}}{a named numeric vector.  The names denote response
      patterns, the values denote their frequencies.}
  }

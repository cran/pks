Changes in 0.4-1

  * BUG FIX: blim(..., method = "MDML") could fail when (b)eta estimates were
    too close to zero (reported by Martin Losert)
  * *.Rd: add DOIs to all references
  * DESCRIPTION: new URL

Changes in 0.4-0

  * blim(): more flexible infrastructure for setting parameter constraints;
    errequal and errtype arguments are now deprecated in favor of
    betaequal/etaequal and betafix/etafix
  * New functions: anova.blim(), coef.blim(), deviance.blim()
  * as.pattern(..., as.set = TRUE), as.binmat(): work in more cases including
    when R or N.R do not contain the empty set
  * chess and probability data sets: extended examples
  * NAMESPACE: import graphics

Changes in 0.3-1

  * BUG FIX: delineate() could return wrong knowledge structure when skillfun
    had numeric itemIDs (or factor itemIDs in non-alphabetic order)
  * New function: jacobian(), Jacobian matrix of a BLIM (draft version)
  * delineate(): each element of classes is now a matrix; itemID is now the
    index of the column that holds the item indicator
  * blim(): new zeropad argument; per default, an incomplete response vector
    is completed and padded with zeros

Changes in 0.3-0

  * New function: delineate(), knowledge structure delineated by skill
    function
  * New functions: is.forward.graded(), is.backward.graded()
  * blim(): add random initial values for randinit = TRUE
  * tests/sampling.R: add tests for uniform sampling
  * blim(): recalculate degrees of freedom in goodness-of-fit test
  * as.pattern(): add as.set argument; if TRUE return value is of class "set"
  * as.binmat(): conversion from class set to matrix 
  * DESCRIPTION: depend on package sets

Changes in 0.2-1

  * BUG FIX: simulate.blim() made incorrect predictions
  * New data set: endm
  * CITATION: add reference to ENDM paper

Changes in 0.2-0

  * BUG FIX: likelihood and fitted values reported by blim() were incorrect
  * blim(): add estimators for errequal = TRUE, speed up some computations
  * New data sets: density97, matter97
  * as.pattern(): add as.letters argument for a letter representation of
    response patterns
  * CITATION: add reference to Psychoco 2012 talk

Changes in 0.1-0

  * initial release on CRAN
  * Function blim() for fitting and testing basic local independence models
  * Extractor functions for blim objects (some work automatically by
    inheritance): simulate(), print(), logLik(), nobs(), resid(), fitted(),
    plot(), AIC(), BIC()
  * Conversion functions: as.pattern() and as.binmat()
  * Data sets: DoignonFalmagne7, chess, probability

Description: Fitting and testing probabilistic knowledge structures,
  especially the basic local independence model (BLIM, Doignon & Flamagne,
  1999) and the simple learning model (SLM), using the minimum discrepancy
  maximum likelihood (MDML) method (Heller & Wickelmaier, 2013
  <doi:10.1016/j.endm.2013.05.145>).

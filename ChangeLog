Changes in 0.6-0

  * DESCRIPTION: suggests relations and Rgraphviz for plotting knowledge
    structures and precedence relations, see examples in is.subset() and
    in ita()
  * New vignette: vignette("EstimationStepByStep", package = "pks"), parameter
    estimation methods implemented in the package
  * New function: slm(), fitting and testing simple learning models
  * New function: getKFringe(), outer and inner fringes of a knowledge
    structure
  * New function: is.downgradable(), check for downgradabiliy
  * conversion.R: as.pattern(..., useNames = TRUE) uses item names to
    represent response patterns, as.letters argument is deprecated
  * ita.R: ita() gains search argument for local or global threshold search;
    returns precedence relation as a logical incidence matrix
  * New function: is.subset(), subset relation incidence matrix
  * New function: blimit(), BLIM identification analysis (adapted from
    Stefanutti et al., 2012)
  * New data sets: fraction17 (Stefanutti and de Chiusole, 2017),
    subtraction13 (de Chiusole and Stefanutti, 2013)

Changes in 0.5-0

  * blim(): use (if possible) matrix multiplication to compute the conditional
    distribution of response patterns given knowledge state; remove deprecated
    errequal and errtype arguments; increase default zeropad to 16
  * New function: ita(), item tree analysis
  * conversion.R: as.binmat() gains as.logical argument
  * chess data: correct mistakes in dst1 and dst4; add raw data and
    replication code
  * *.Rd: update references

Changes in 0.4-1

  * BUG FIX: blim(..., method = "MDML") could fail when (b)eta estimates were
    too close to zero (reported by Martin Losert)
  * *.Rd: add DOIs to all references
  * DESCRIPTION: new URL

Changes in 0.4-0

  * blim(): more flexible infrastructure for setting parameter constraints;
    errequal and errtype arguments are now deprecated in favor of
    betaequal/etaequal and betafix/etafix
  * New functions: anova.blim(), coef.blim(), deviance.blim()
  * as.pattern(..., as.set = TRUE), as.binmat(): work in more cases including
    when R or N.R do not contain the empty set
  * chess and probability data sets: extended examples
  * NAMESPACE: import graphics

Changes in 0.3-1

  * BUG FIX: delineate() could return wrong knowledge structure when skillfun
    had numeric itemIDs (or factor itemIDs in non-alphabetic order)
  * New function: jacobian(), Jacobian matrix of a BLIM (draft version)
  * delineate(): each element of classes is now a matrix; itemID is now the
    index of the column that holds the item indicator
  * blim(): new zeropad argument; per default, an incomplete response vector
    is completed and padded with zeros

Changes in 0.3-0

  * New function: delineate(), knowledge structure delineated by skill
    function
  * New functions: is.forward.graded(), is.backward.graded()
  * blim(): add random initial values for randinit = TRUE
  * tests/sampling.R: add tests for uniform sampling
  * blim(): recalculate degrees of freedom in goodness-of-fit test
  * as.pattern(): add as.set argument; if TRUE return value is of class "set"
  * as.binmat(): conversion from class set to matrix 
  * DESCRIPTION: depend on package sets

Changes in 0.2-1

  * BUG FIX: simulate.blim() made incorrect predictions
  * New data set: endm
  * CITATION: add reference to ENDM paper

Changes in 0.2-0

  * BUG FIX: likelihood and fitted values reported by blim() were incorrect
  * blim(): add estimators for errequal = TRUE, speed up some computations
  * New data sets: density97, matter97
  * as.pattern(): add as.letters argument for a letter representation of
    response patterns
  * CITATION: add reference to Psychoco 2012 talk

Changes in 0.1-0

  * initial release on CRAN
  * Function blim() for fitting and testing basic local independence models
  * Extractor functions for blim objects (some work automatically by
    inheritance): simulate(), print(), logLik(), nobs(), resid(), fitted(),
    plot(), AIC(), BIC()
  * Conversion functions: as.pattern() and as.binmat()
  * Data sets: DoignonFalmagne7, chess, probability

Changes in 0.2-0

  * BUG FIX: likelihood and fitted values reported by blim() were incorrect
  * blim(): add estimators for errequal = TRUE, speed up some computations
  * New data sets: density97, matter97
  * as.pattern(): add as.letters argument for a letter representation of
    response patterns
  * CITATION: add reference to Psychoco 2012 talk

Changes in 0.1-0

  * initial release on CRAN
  * Function blim() for fitting and testing basic local independence models
  * Extractor functions for blim objects (some work automatically by
    inheritance): simulate(), print(), logLik(), nobs(), resid(), fitted(),
    plot(), AIC(), BIC()
  * Conversion functions: as.pattern() and as.binmat()
  * Data sets: DoignonFalmagne7, chess, probability
